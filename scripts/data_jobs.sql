--**BONUS:**
--You want to understand which jobs requiring SQL are hard to fill. Find the number of jobs by industry (domain) that require SQL and have been posted longer than 3 weeks. 

SELECT domain
FROM data_analyst_jobs
WHERE skill = 'SQL' 
AND days_since_posting >21;

	--CORRECTION

SELECT domain, COUNT(domain) AS count_domain
FROM data_analyst_jobs
WHERE skill = 'SQL' 
AND days_since_posting >21
GROUP by domain;



-- - Disregard any postings where the domain is NULL. 

SELECT domain
FROM data_analyst_jobs
WHERE skill = 'SQL' 
AND days_since_posting >21

	--CORRECTION
	
SELECT domain, COUNT(domain) AS count_domain
FROM data_analyst_jobs
WHERE skill = 'SQL'
